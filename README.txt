*ABOUT THIS REPORT*

We will try and make an attempt to improve on the results presented by S. Moro, R. Laureano and P.. Cortez, 
the authors of Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology.
 
To determine whether a customer will subscribe to the bank’s deposit, the data mining techniques would 
be more suited for a classification problem. Thus, this report will conduct data mining techniques that 
use classification models rather than clustering or nearest neighbour models to achieve the desired results.
